# Foundation eight-direction body atlas provenance

This directory contains the active body-and-clothing-only production candidate
for Oh Tipi, S. Wayne and The Red Baron. Every grounded, empty-hand cast, hit/recovery, jump,
slide, and roll state has dedicated `S/SE/E/NE/N/NW/W/SW` art. Walk and sprint
also have two opposite contact frames in all eight directions, selected on the
editable presentation motion profile's half-cycle. Spells,
elements, auras, projectiles, shadows, environments, tools, and equipment remain
independent runtime layers, so a pose or spell can be replaced without redrawing
the other.

The active runtime is `runtime_atlas_eight_v11.png`: 768×2880 RGBA, 96×96
cells, eight fixed direction columns, ten state/contact rows per champion and
pivot `(48,84)`. It is built in two deterministic stages:

```

The second stage adds The Red Baron at an authored 68 px body height, preserves
all champions at runtime scale `1.00`, then derives one restrained exterior ink
from the darkest visible Red Baron material clusters. The one-pixel pass is
bounded to each cell: it cannot recolor, resize, merge or bleed silhouettes.

```

The builder uses proportional source-cell boundaries because the generated
1254px canvas is not divisible by four. It removes only edge-connected magenta,
uses one bounded scale per champion, aligns every cell to the shared feet pivot,
packs the versioned atlas, and fails if any required source cell is empty.
Source sheets are normalized by their four-column cell width before the shared
champion scale is calculated, so generated sheets with different canvas sizes
cannot silently resize one action family.
Exact source, PNG, and Godot-imported RGBA hashes
are pinned in `provenance.json`.

Grid contract: columns left to right SOUTH-EAST/front-right, NORTH-EAST/back-right, NORTH-WEST/back-left, SOUTH-WEST/front-left. Rows top to bottom: (1) WALK OPPOSITE CONTACT, swapping planted/passing legs and counter-swinging arms compared with Image 1; (2) SPRINT OPPOSITE DRIVE with stronger lean and stride; (3) JUMP with both feet visibly airborne, compact rising pose and arms balancing; (4) SLIDE, low elongated feet-first pose aligned precisely with facing; (5) ROLL, compact tucked somersault silhouette aligned precisely with facing. Preserve all four diagonal facings, stable centered feet pivot where applicable, scale, round dark hair, warm dark skin, purple-and-gold short cloak, large bare hobbit feet, compact non-sexualized proportions and crisp outline.
Scene/backdrop: one flat opaque vivid magenta matte over the entire canvas with generous separation between equal cells.
Style/medium: original charming compact cartoon pixel art matching the inputs; economical pixel clusters readable around 58 pixels tall; no smooth painting.
Constraints: body and clothing pixels only; exactly one S. Wayne per cell; empty hands; no text, labels, borders, shadows, magic, elements, aura, projectiles, particles, dust, speed lines, weapons, tools, equipment, props or environment; no cropped figures or overlap.
Avoid: cardinal facings, duplicated first-contact poses, ambiguous direction, extra limbs, inconsistent scale, spell pixels, detached objects, logos, watermark.

Human visual/originality acceptance is still required before final-art
promotion; automated validation proves structure, provenance, importability,
layer separation, and live mapping only.
