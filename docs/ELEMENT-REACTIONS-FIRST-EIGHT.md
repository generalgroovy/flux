# First-eight element reaction contract

Status: **C5 compiled and compatibility-bound; world mutation gated until C6**.

This contract defines the first chemistry interaction set for the eight currently
promoted element families: **Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, Ice, Charge, Light, and
Dark**. It is deliberately limited to those eight families until the fundamental
material/reaction stack passes its full acceptance gate.

`Spirit`, `Chaos`, `Gravity`, and `Time` remain declared thematic families but
are excluded from this reaction contract and remain runtime-gated. They must not
receive production reaction behavior before the first-eight fundamentals are
accepted at the authoritative 120 Hz with reset, replay, worldbone, network, performance,
and readability evidence.

The C5 compiler assigns stable wires `301–336`, resolves both input orders to
one canonical definition, and maps every pair onto nine shared spatial
primitives and seven clamped integer channels. Global/per-reaction area,
propagation, lifetime, work, event and ownership capacities validate before
boot and contribute to Farflow compatibility. `runtime_enabled` remains false:
this is executable truth, not permission for presentation or content to mutate
the material grid before C6 exposure/contact authority exists.

## Design law

FLUX reactions are a **map-state interaction network**, not an elemental weakness
wheel. Element combinations should change routes, surfaces, structures,
visibility, trajectories, movement, timing, cover, information, or resource
pressure. Damage is useful but secondary to changing the decision space.

Every promoted reaction must:

1. derive from deterministic simulation state rather than rendered pixels;
2. have visible formation, active, and residue/decay stages where applicable;
3. expose thresholds or preparation for strong effects rather than triggering
   maximal outcomes from a single incidental contact;
4. preserve immutable worldbone and required spawn/objective connectivity;
5. declare bounded area, propagation depth, lifetime, work cost, and ownership;
6. expose counterplay through movement, material manipulation, geometry, or a
   second reaction;
7. use shape, motion, timing and residue in addition to color;
8. reset exactly and replay identically at the selected authoritative tick rate.

## Interaction matrix

Each unordered pair has exactly one baseline reaction identity. The same pair is
symmetric; order of application may affect thresholds/current state but never
select a different undocumented reaction.

## Detailed reaction table

| Pair | Reaction | Map interaction | Fighter/gameplay effects | Counter / evolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Earth + Earth | **Fortify** | Compacts loose Earth into temporary ridges, ramps or reinforced cover. | Blocks compatible projectiles and creates wall-kick/vault geometry. | Damage fractures it to rubble; Water softens; Magma can consume/remake it. |
| Earth + Fire | **Magma** | Heated mutable Earth melts, follows elevation/low channels, then cools through crust into basalt. | Strong short DoT and ground denial; burns wood/growth and softens destructible stone. | Water causes steam + rapid cooling; Ice accelerates solidification; basalt can later fracture to rubble. |
| Earth + Water | **Mud** | Soil becomes viscous and can creep downhill. | Lower acceleration, shorter slides and weaker takeoff; heavy traffic churns it. | Fire dries it, Ice freezes it, Wind strips thin layers. |
| Earth + Wind | **Dustfront** | Loose soil/rubble becomes a directional dust cloud. | Partial vision obstruction plus weak lateral push; projectile silhouettes remain readable. | Water drops it into mud; solid geometry interrupts travel. |
| Earth + Ice | **Permafrost** | Moist Earth locks into rigid frozen soil/ice-stone terrain. | Temporary hard route/cover; impact can apply Brittle and fracture it. | Repeated impacts create ice + rubble; Fire thaws it. |
| Earth + Charge | **Grounding Network** | Connected grounded surfaces/devices preferentially drain and route Charge. | Creates temporary anti-Charge safe regions but may accumulate energy at explicit grounding nodes. | Overloaded nodes discharge; Water may bridge around a grounded section. |
| Earth + Light | **Crystal Prism** | Mineral surfaces grow temporary reflective/prismatic facets. | Predictably redirects compatible rays/projectiles and creates angled cover. | Fracture destroys facets; Dark dulls/occludes them. |
| Earth + Dark | **Blightsoil** | Soil becomes exhausted terrain that suppresses growth and weakens mutable structure. | Mild slow, reduced authored healing/growth and gradual structural attrition. | Light cleanses patches; Water spreads but dilutes it. |
| Fire + Fire | **Conflagration** | Adjacent fire merges into a hotter, shorter-lived front and consumes fuel faster. | Increased DoT and area denial with an intentionally obvious silhouette. | Fuel exhaustion collapses it into smoke/ash; Water cools it. |
| Fire + Water | **Steam** | Water flashes into an expanding gas volume. | Brief scald near formation, then primarily LOS/aim occlusion rather than sustained damage. | Wind moves/parts it, Ice condenses/freezes it, enough Water removes heat. |
| Fire + Wind | **Firestorm** | Wind stretches flame along its vector and may cross bounded small fuel gaps. | Moving DoT front cuts routes and retreats. | Water barriers and nonflammable structure break propagation; vector remains visible. |
| Fire + Ice | **Thermal Shock** | Sufficient rapid hot/cold delta stresses glass, stone, ice and authored structures. | High structural fracture/Brittle and a small nearby stagger, not arbitrary bonus damage. | Requires real thermal thresholds; avoid or equalize temperature. |
| Fire + Charge | **Plasma Arc** | Highly energized flame briefly branches toward eligible conductors. | Burst damage + short interrupt; can ignite nearby fuel. | Very short-lived; grounding and cover break arcs. |
| Fire + Light | **Solar Flare** | Combustion becomes an intense illuminated zone. | Burns away concealment and causes brief facing-dependent glare/readability pressure. | Cover blocks flare; Dark can collapse it toward Cinderveil. |
| Fire + Dark | **Cinderveil** | Fire shifts into dim long-lived ember/smoke pressure. | Lower initial damage, longer DoT and localized concealment. | Wind exposes/moves it, Light reveals through it, Water creates dirty steam. |
| Water + Water | **Flood** | Water depth increases and follows elevation into connected basins. | Lower acceleration, longer displacement/knockback carry and unstable slides. | Pumps/drains/barriers and elevation reshape the basin; serves as substrate for other reactions. |
| Water + Wind | **Mistcurrent** | Wind atomizes water into a moving mist corridor. | Mild vision reduction, slight air-steering assistance with flow and Fire suppression. | Continued Wind disperses it; Ice turns it toward frost/hail. |
| Water + Ice | **Freeze** | Water progressively becomes traversable ice. | Low friction: longer slides, weaker braking/counter-strafe and possible temporary shortcuts. | Impact fractures thin ice; Fire melts; load/elevation governs breakage. |
| Water + Charge | **Conductive Flood** | Charge propagates through contiguous wet/water cells after a visible warning pulse. | Periodic damage + brief interrupt in the network. | Leave/break the wet path, ground it or wait for bounded dissipation. |
| Water + Light | **Mirrorwater** | Calm water becomes reflective/refractive. | Reveals disturbances/silhouettes and redirects compatible Light paths predictably. | Wind breaks the surface, Earth muddies it, Dark creates Blackwater. |
| Water + Dark | **Blackwater** | Water becomes opaque and contaminated. | Conceals ground hazards, applies slight slow and weak prolonged immersed attrition. | Light cleanses, fresh Water dilutes, Ice locks it into Black Ice. |
| Wind + Wind | **Vortex** | Intersecting pressure creates a rotating airflow cell. | Redirects light projectiles, loose matter and airborne actors; outer edge can become movement tech. | Heavy bodies resist; force weakens toward the readable center. |
| Wind + Ice | **Hailstream** | Wind accelerates ice particles through a lane. | Repeated light damage + slow pressure. | Solid cover stops it; Fire melts it toward mist. |
| Wind + Charge | **Ion Storm** | Charged particles become a drifting electrical weather field. | Periodic low damage plus bounded startup/interrupt pressure. | Grounding reduces it; enclosure and opposing pressure constrain travel. |
| Wind + Light | **Lightbend** | Pressure field curves compatible Light geometry. | Redirects beams/projectiles to create readable curved firing lanes. | Flow vectors must be visible; changing/removing Wind restores ordinary paths. |
| Wind + Dark | **Shadowdraft** | Concealment stretches into moving bands. | Provides a mobile disengagement corridor while movement disturbs its edges. | Light slices/reveals it; opposing Wind disperses it. |
| Ice + Ice | **Glacier** | Ice thickens into temporary soft-solid geometry. | Blocks low projectiles and provides climb/vault/route surfaces. | Fire melts it; impact/Earth fractures it into chunks. |
| Ice + Charge | **Superconduct** | Cold conductive paths preserve and focus Charge into narrower routes. | Charge can travel farther/faster but becomes more predictable. | Break/heat the frozen conductor to interrupt the network. |
| Ice + Light | **Crystal Lens** | Ice forms an optical prism/lens. | Splits or redirects Light into several weaker predictable paths and can expose concealment. | Impact shatters it; Fire deforms/melts it. |
| Ice + Dark | **Black Ice** | Dark suppresses the normal readable shine of ice. | Very slippery route; crossing actors leave brief disturbed-frost marks. | Light makes it obvious/reflective; Fire removes it. |
| Charge + Charge | **Overload** | Connected storage/conductors saturate toward a visible threshold. | Telegraph -> discharge: damage + interrupt/knockback. | Ground or deliberately discharge before threshold. |
| Charge + Light | **Arcflash** | Discharge creates a bright temporary conductive path. | Short interrupt + reveal/outline along the arc. | Cover breaks line; Dark reduces reveal lifetime without cancelling electricity. |
| Charge + Dark | **Static Shroud** | Dark hides the main discharge while electrical noise remains. | Concealment with static silhouettes on entry/exit and weak interrupt risk. | Light converts static cues to full reveal; grounding drains it. |
| Light + Light | **Radiance** | Overlap establishes a bounded strongly illuminated zone. | Strong reveal and concealment suppression; healing/protection only when an authored ability explicitly owns it. | Solid cover blocks transmission; Dark contests the boundary. |
| Light + Dark | **Penumbra** | A high-contrast boundary forms instead of either element simply cancelling. | Crossing briefly outlines/marks actors; projectiles crossing become especially legible. | Manipulate either source to move the boundary. |
| Dark + Dark | **Umbral Field** | Darkness accumulates into a capped low-information region. | Concealment, reduced external reveal and weak attrition only after prolonged exposure. | Motion creates readable ripples/silhouettes; Light erodes from edges inward. |

## Flagship lifecycle: Magma -> basalt -> rubble

`Earth + Fire -> Magma` is the flagship proof that reactions change the map
rather than merely apply status damage.

Canonical target lifecycle:

```text
mutable Earth
  -> heated Earth
  -> Magma
  -> elevation-driven molten flow
  -> cooling crust
  -> Basalt (temporary round structure/route)
  -> fracture
  -> Rubble
```

Water striking Magma may simultaneously create **Steam** and accelerate cooling.
This permits a deliberate chain such as:

```text
melt route -> force rotation -> water-cool crossing -> create basalt bridge
-> fracture bridge -> rubble alters lower route
```

All stages remain bounded and worldbone-safe. Basalt must be an explicit material
or typed structural state before this reaction can be promoted to runtime.

## Implementation priority

The initial acceptance order is:

1. Magma / cooling crust / basalt / rubble lifecycle;
2. Freeze;
3. Conductive Flood;
4. Steam;
5. Mud;
6. Crystal Prism;
7. Vortex;
8. Thermal Shock;
9. Penumbra;
10. Black Ice;
11. remaining first-eight pairs in bounded subsystem groups.

for the executable slice plan.

## Deferred families

`Spirit`, `Chaos`, `Gravity`, and `Time` stay in the twelve-family thematic
catalog so stable IDs do not need to be reinvented. They remain runtime-gated
and receive **no production reaction contract in this checkpoint**. Their
interaction design may be reconsidered only after all first-eight fundamental
acceptance criteria pass and the team has measured complexity, readability,
performance, replay stability and network cost from the real system.
